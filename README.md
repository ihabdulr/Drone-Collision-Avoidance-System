# Drone-Collision-Avoidance-System
A course project that leverages mutex-locks such that no "drone" should occupy the same place-- I.E: collision avoidance.

To execute my program:
> Download the source files 
> Navigate to "Lab1\src\"
> "Make"

> Following the compilation to binaries, execute the following command: 
      ./dcas 1 0 3 0 3 9 3 8 5 0 7 0 4 8 4 10 9 0 11 0 5 13 6 19 13 0 15 0 7 14 8 11 17 0 6 2

*****THINGS TO NOTE*****

-There are a total of 9 airports. 
-Each Airport begins in column 0 and every airport that follows the first, is separated by 1 row. 
-Command arguments go as follows:
startpositionDrone1, startposition Drone2, destinationDrone1, destinationDrone2, startpositionDrone3, startposition Drone4, destinationDrone3, destination Drone4,startpositionDrone5, startposition Drone6, destinationDrone5, destinationDrone6, startpositionDrone7, startposition Drone8, destinationDrone7, destination Drone8, startpositionDrone9, destination Drone9,


This project is not the best representation of my code prowess, however I enjoyed the result and thought I'd share. 
Took me roughly 8 hours to code, albeit spaghetti =P
